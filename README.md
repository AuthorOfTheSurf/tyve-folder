This is the Tyve web application. The Tyve app is a goal-oriented timing service that allows users to track their progress towards clocking 20 hours into any activity. Users will be able to add timers and use multiple timers simultaneously in numerous, flexible ways. I want users to feel like they are able to log their progress in a quick and honest matter.


Extras:
*	I think it would be an interesting mechanic to have users be prompted to submit a Tyve report after completing 20 hours in their calling. It would be a simple submission post with the user's name (or Anonymous), the activity they completed 20 hours in and a short word of their thoughts and experiences--really anything they want, just words--thoughts--yeah.
*	I want to have the suggestions for activities looking nice and being positive and well-chosen, useful to the users.
*	Adding images should be fluid and easy.
*	Reason's why 20 is the important milestone. More specifically, this app is inspired by an article that I read, it is, in a way, intended to teach the key idea of the article--that 20 hours of practice can make you better than 99% of people--whilst also providing a nice app for which to track such a period of time.
*	Should have a motivational-feeling ui. I am thinking light yellow with a well-chosen blue.
